# Stanley Planes Restoration
I bought some old Stanley planes since I was curious about the restoration process. One of them is missing a blade, so I'll have to either get one or just put it aside.
I started by trying to disassemble and clean them, but the screws were too rusty and stuck. So the first step was to apply some WD-40 and scour them with a wire brush drill attachment.
I don't usually think too many steps ahead and work in a serial way, but I once I realised how many parts one of them has, I decided I'll do them one by one or at least try to separate the parts.
This ikea plastic box turned out to bee very useful, since it fit across my belfast sink, and just the right depth.
I placed the parts in the box and poured some white vinegar on them. I had no idea white vinegar removes rust. I use it to clean my coffee machine from scale, but didn't know it's good for rust too.
